# SimpleWordle
A very simple wordle that use https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as word list. This is to refresh my coding skill. All credits goes to the original owner of the idea. JSON loaded using Newtonsoft.Json.

At first I use en-wiktionary dump as my word database. Then I am too lazy to clean the wordlist. Maybe in the future I will create a good cleaner for that.
